            <section class="overview">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Laerdal Medical's new Support and Help solution is designed to empower customers with a seamless, self-service platform for troubleshooting and resolving issues efficiently. The primary goal is to reduce dependency on support teams while improving customer satisfaction and response times. This solution includes both embedded and standalone versions, with the current focus on the standalone version to enhance accessibility and usability.</p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    As the lead UX designer, I was responsible for crafting an intuitive and efficient user experience. My contributions included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted in-depth user research to uncover pain points.</li>
                    <li>Defined user flows and restructured information architecture.</li>
                    <li>Designed interactive prototypes and tested them with real users.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with stakeholders, developers, and support teams.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
    
            <section class="challenge">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <h3>High Support Dependency</h3>
                <p>Customers struggled to find answers independently, leading to frustration and increased reliance on Laerdal’s help desk. In many cases, their first point of contact was a salesperson, who then redirected them to the support team—unnecessarily prolonging resolution times.</p>
                
                <h3>Lack of Proactive Support</h3>
                <p>Support materials were often insufficient or difficult to navigate. Given Laerdal’s extensive product range, customers found it challenging to locate relevant information for troubleshooting or best practices.</p>
